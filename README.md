# My Personal Profile Page
This is my first project for the Front End Web Development Tech-degree (Treehouse). I practiced my web design skills by customizing a web page to create a personal profile. I added graphics, custom text, and a stylish design. 

I added two extra HTML pages, new images, additional text and personalized design.  I also added navigation links to move smoothly between pages and a link with my email.
